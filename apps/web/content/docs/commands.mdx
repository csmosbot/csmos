Commands are the backbone of csmos. They are what you and your members run on your Discord server to interact with csmos. This is a tutorial on how to use them and how to view all commands that csmos supports.

## Using commands

To use a command from csmos, you can use Discord's built-in slash commands, which csmos supports. Just run `/` + the name of your command. An example is `/help`.

import { Info } from "lucide-react";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";

<Alert className="border-blue-400/50 mt-6">
  <Info className="!text-blue-400 h-4 w-4" />
  <AlertTitle className="text-blue-400 pb-1">Note</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    If you want to learn more about slash commands, you can read [Discord's blog
    post about them and how they
    work](https://discord.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-discord-apps?ref=badge).
