Do you want to start using csmos for your Discord server? Well this is the guide for you! In just a few simple steps, you'll have csmos in your server, and you'll be ready to start your dream Discord server.

## Invite csmos

Let's add csmos to your Discord server! First, go to [csmos.space/invite](https://csmos.space/invite). This should lead you to a page like this:

![Select a server](/getting-started/invite-1.png)

Select the server that you want to add csmos in, then click "Continue". You should then be sent to a page like this"

![Authorize](/getting-started/invite-2.png)

If you want, you can deselect some of the permissions we have by default, but we recommend leaving it as most of these permissions are required by some features of csmos. Once you're ready, click "Authorize". You should then see a page like this:

![Authorized](/getting-started/invite-3.png)

This means that csmos has been invited into your server! If you check your server, you should see csmos in your member list like this:

![csmos in the server](/getting-started/invite-4.png)

csmos is now in your server and you can now start building your dream Discord server!
