Welcome to the csmos documentation! This is where you can learn more about csmos and how to use it.

## What is csmos?

csmos is a multipurpose Discord bot aimed to help you build the Discord server of your dreams, while letting your members have fun.

It has multiple features that allow you to make your Discord server **_yours_**, while still allowing members to have their occasional fun.

## Why csmos?

csmos has many features baked in that are completely free to use that other bots need you to pay for. For example, csmos has leveling for completely free, while another popular bot named [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz) requires you to pay for premium to be able to use it.

## Will I have to pay for everything?

No! csmos is fully free, and will remain so for the forseeable future. Our code is also [open soruce](https://github.com/csmosspace/csmos), so you can host your own csmos for your server!
