Commands are the backbone of csmos. They are what you and your members run on your Discord server to interact with csmos. This is a tutorial on how to use them and how to view all commands that csmos supports.

## Using commands

To use a command from csmos, you can use Discord's built-in slash commands, which csmos supports. Just run `/` + the name of your command. An example is `/help`.

:::note
If you want to learn more about slash commands, you can read [Discord's blog post about them and how they work](https://discord.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-discord-apps?ref=badge).

## View all commands

To view all the commands csmos supports, you can run [`/help`](/commands/information/help) in your Discord server, and csmos will reply with a list of all its commands. You can also type `/` and click on csmos' avatar to see all of its slash commands.
