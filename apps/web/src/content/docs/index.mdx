  <Card title="Easy to setup" icon="rocket">
    csmos makes it easy to setup and start building your dream Discord server.
    Just add it to your server and start building. No complicated setup wizard.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep your members engaged" icon="puzzle">
    Your server isn't just about moderating the chat, you have to keep your
    members engaged and active, and csmos helps with that.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Best of all, it's free!" icon="star">
    No credit card required. csmos is completely free to use, and will be for as
    long as we live (or well, until our solar system explodes). We care more
    about the community than a large sum of cash.
  </Card>
  <Card title="We're open source" icon="github">
    Don't trust our code? Do you think we're hiding some secret tracking code?
    Don't worry, because [all of our code is open
    source](https://github.com/CosmoticLabs/csmos), which means you can view all
    of it and see what's running behind the scenes.
